# Digital-Signal-Processing-Package
This package is for one dimensional signal processing, including transforms like the fourier transform and the inverse fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other algorithms that help in:

1. Digitization of analog signals.
2. Filtering signals using window method (windows used : hanning, hamming, blackman).
3. Convolution of signals.
4. Correlation of signals. 
5. Extracting signals from noise using correlation.
6. Other algorithms that help clean the data.

All algorithms are built from scartch and are found in DSPComponents/Algorithms/
